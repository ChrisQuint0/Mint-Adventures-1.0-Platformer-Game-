# Mint-Adventures-1.0-Platformer-Game-
A platformer game I made using SFML and C++. An attempt and effort to create a horror game disguised as cute and innocent. 

I made the game in ONE SINGLE MAIN FILE. I know what you're thinking, this is not best practice and I should have worked on the game in multiple files.
But hey, interestingly it worked. There's a warning though, in visual studio it says "Warning	C6262	Function uses '95048' bytes of stack.  Consider moving some data to heap."

Although the game worked and it's playable, there's going to be difficulties in regards of maintaining it because as I said, I made the whole game in one main CPP file.
In total it has 10,000 lines.
